Elias Ekberg Gasper ðŸ¦§

I'm a self-taught JavaScript developer building tools that help people understand and improve their digital habits.  
Currently building a Chrome extension that tracks tab usage and visualizes your browsing behavior for productivity insights.

> I'm thinking like a product-focused developer â€” building tools that solve real problems and could grow into something bigger.

## ðŸš€ Projects I'm Building
- ðŸ”§ **Chrome Productivity Tracker**  
  A Chrome extension (in private repo for now) that helps users visualize their internet habits to make better decisions.

## ðŸ“ˆ Goals
- Launch and share 2 real-world projects by end of year  
- Land my first backend developer job by early 2026  
- Learn more about user data visualization and behavior design  
- Explore turning a personal tool into a lightweight SaaS  
- **Transition into building AI-powered backend tools and infrastructure**

## ðŸ”’ Why Some Projects Are Private
Some of my current projects are private as I explore turning them into real products.  
Once ready, Iâ€™ll publish code samples, demo links, or a breakdown of the architecture :^)
